00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
In this video I will show you how to use Javascript
to make a request to an external API

2
00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.700
And show this information within our document

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.780
I have the open document here and the first part
that I'm going to create it is our HTML

4
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.880
I will create a <section class ="company">
That would contain the company information

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.160
And I'll put it in here
<p>Name:</p> with the company name

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.080
I'll put <span class="name"></span>
That will be where we will fill the data

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.640
And I'll duplicate it to have the price too
Then there will be the name and price of the share

8
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.440
Save it, now we can start JavaScript

9
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.230
Then <script> starts and the first thing
what I need is to open a http connection

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.120
So I'm going to create a constant here
const http = new XMLHttpRequest();

11
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.500
I already opened a requisition, now I have to notify
which url I'm looking for this information

12
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.180
Then you put http.open(); to open that connection
You say which method of connection

13
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.140
You want the GET, which is to pull information
And the 2nd argument is the url we are going to use

14
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:19.960
I'll copy and paste here and now we need
to send this request http.send();

15
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.320
So it's already open for us
Now I will deal with the error

16
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.960
If this request does not occur
What is he going happen?

17
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.980
I will then create a function
called: handleError();

18
00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.920
And to show the user, I'm going to select this
entire <section class="company"> element

19
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.440
const company = document.querySelector(".company")

20
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:51.160
And I will change his entire html and show an error
company.innerHtml = "<p>Error.</p>";

21
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.020
Save it, and what’s missing now is to inform
when this function should occur

22
00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.660
It should take place here at the event
http.addEventListener("error", handleError);

23
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.220
So whenever the "error" event happens
it fires the handleError() function

24
00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.700
The next function is when
this content is loaded

25
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.540
I'll call function handleLoad();

26
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.440
So as soon as it's loaded,
what will happen to it...

27
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.220
I'll add here in
http.addEventListener("load", handleLoad);

28
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.410
I a load event I want that this
handleLoad() function; be activated

29
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.700
In this role I will have to declarethe event
function handleLoad(event);

30
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.420
Because I want to get that specific http element
And the answer that comes with it

31
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:39.060
So I'll put
const response = event.target.response;

32
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.560
A text response with Apple information
console.log(response); saved, see all Apple info

33
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.940
We will now turn this text into an object
const data = JSON.parse(response);

34
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.360
Because this text is a JSON type text
So I'm going to parse this answer

35
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.300
It will now become an object so that
we can access direct information

36
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:11.460
Now I’ll select my "name" element
const name = document.querySelector(".name");

37
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.220
And I will also access the ".price"
I will then simply change the text of these items

38
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.500
name.innerText = data.profile.companyName;

39
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.300
Because it's in the "profile", take a look,
There is "symbol" then there is "profile"

40
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.280
And within the profile I have a price which is the "price"
 and I have "companyName" that I want to show

41
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.180
name.innerText = data.profile.companyName;
price.innerText = data.price;

42
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.120
Save it, let's take a look
It's already filling out our information

43
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.840
For you to see if it's really working
You can come here and switch to another symbol

44
00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:03.920
For example / MSFT which is from Microsoft
Saved, and it shows the name and current price of the stock
